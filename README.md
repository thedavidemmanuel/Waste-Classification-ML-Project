# Waste Management Classification App

## Overview

In Africa, effective waste management is a significant challenge due to the increasing population and urbanization. This project explores the potential of AI to offer a solution to this problem by automating the classification of waste, thus improving recycling processes and promoting environmental sustainability.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset comprising 22,500 images of organic and recyclable objects obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data).

## Training

The model training was conducted on Google Colab using a T4 GPU, ensuring efficient learning and model performance.

## Application

The Streamlit app, hosted [here](https://waste-classification-ml-project.streamlit.app/), serves as a user-friendly interface for waste image classification.

## How to Use

1. Visit the Streamlit app link.
2. Upload an image of the waste item.
3. View the classification results.
4. Contribute to proper waste management by disposing of items as directed.
